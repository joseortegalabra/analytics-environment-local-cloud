- version_1_analytics_env_local: Using docker-compose to build the analytics environment with docker. This works to build the container locally
but in cloud this is not possible and needs only the dockerfile


- version_2_analytics_env_local_cloud: Modification of version_1, translading the docker-compose into the docker-file to build the container locally and
in cloud without problems
